CAD [1] (Computer-Aided Design or Computer-Aided Design and Drawing) is the use of technology to create designs (generally 2D) and replaces the manual drawing process of a piece with an automated one. One of the most popular such programs is AutoCAD. Such programs improve the designer's design quality and productivity.
